Steps to play with this code.
         If you want to DEBUG.
	1)Open the Client .vbg and the Server .vbg in seperate instances of VB.

	2)In the Server instance of VB press (Control + F5) this will start the server with full compile.

	3)Start the client piece in you favorite debug way.
		ex. F8, F5 with a Breakpoint

If this was elementary info for you sorry I wasted your time.
